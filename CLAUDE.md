# CLAUDE.md

AI video pipeline: rough text idea → shot plan JSON → AI images → optional animation →
TTS voiceover → FFmpeg assembly → `output/<name>/final.mp4`. See README.md for the full
user guide; this file covers what an agent needs to work on the codebase safely.

## Commands

```bash
uv sync                                    # install/update deps (creates .venv at repo root)
source .venv/bin/activate                  # activate venv (or prefix commands with `uv run`)
python -m pipeline.refine "idea"           # plan + auto-polish (stage 1, ~$0.001)
python -m pipeline.refine --change "..."   # revise latest plan
python -m pipeline.images                  # stage 2 (free via qwen)
python -m pipeline.video                   # stage 2.5 — DISABLED by default (costs money) — uncomment pipeline/video/__main__.py to re-enable
python -m pipeline.voiceover               # stage 3 (free)
python -m pipeline.assemble [--music f]    # stage 4 (free, local ffmpeg)
python -m pipeline.auto "idea"             # all stages, gate pre-approved (= pipeline.run --approve)
```

All stage commands default to the most recently touched `output/*/` folder
(`latest_work_dir()` in `pipeline/run.py`); pass a folder to target an older video.
`python -m pipeline.run "topic" --approve --animate` is the one-shot path with
resumable `state.json`.

No real test suite — just `tests/test_expand.py` (plain asserts for the
character-substitution logic, run `python -m tests.test_expand`). Verify other
changes by running stages against a copy of `examples/the-sharing-berry/` with
`--backend placeholder` (free, no keys needed).

## Money rules

- **Never run `pipeline.video` (Wan animation) without the user asking** — it spends
  the limited free credit (~1,650s per account, ~5s/scene). Same for adding paid
  backends to a run.
- **gpt-image-1 is never auto-selected** — requires explicit `--backend gpt-image-1`.
  Qwen (free) is always the default first-choice image backend.
- Images via `qwen-image` and plans via `gpt-4o-mini` are effectively free; still,
  show the user the plan/images at review gates before generating downstream assets.
- The user reviews artifacts between stages by preference: plan → images → the rest.

## Architecture in 30 seconds

- `pipeline/schema.py` is the contract: `ShotPlan`/`Scene`/`Character`. Stages
  communicate ONLY via `shot_plan.json` + files in the work dir
  (`images/scene_NN.png`, `video/scene_NN.mp4`, `audio/scene_NN.mp3` + `.words.json`).
- Image/video backends are provider plugins: subclass the base in
  `pipeline/images/base.py` or `pipeline/video/base.py`, append an instance to
  `PROVIDERS` in the package `__init__.py`. Order = auto-pick priority; per-scene
  fallback chain ends at the always-available placeholder.
- Scene durations come from measuring the voiceover mp3s in `assemble.py` —
  never from the plan.
- `.env` at repo root auto-loads (`pipeline/env.py`); empty values are ignored.
  Keys: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` (+ optional `DASHSCOPE_API_URL`
  workspace endpoint), see `.env.example`. Never commit `.env`.

## Hard-won gotchas (do not re-litigate)

- **Character consistency is enforced by code, not the LLM.** LLMs cannot repeat
  descriptions verbatim across scenes — that's why `characters` + `{name}`
  placeholders + `ShotPlan.expand()` exist. Never put a character's look inline in a
  scene prompt; never put pose/emotion in a character description.
- **Character.negative is auto-merged** — bald character, white-haired character,
  clean-shaven character all need their `negative` field set; the pipeline merges it
  into every scene automatically. Never rely on `scene.negative_prompt` alone for
  persistent per-character traits.
- **global_negative goes on ShotPlan, not per-scene** — video-wide rules (no women
  in a male video, no extra limbs, no watermarks) belong in `global_negative`. It is
  merged into every scene in the video.
- **Image models draw negated words** ("no beard" → beard). Unwanted traits go in
  `scene.negative_prompt`, `Character.negative`, or `global_negative` as appropriate.
  If qwen still refuses (strong priors), regenerate that one scene with
  `--backend gpt-image-1` — it follows instructions much better.
- **Animation is disabled** (`pipeline/video/__main__.py` is commented out). Never
  uncomment without the user explicitly asking — it spends DashScope credit.
- **Auto-polish and consistency_review run automatically** on every new plan in both
  `refine.py` and `run.py`. Do not add manual `--polish` calls in scripts.
- **Provider order: Qwen first (free), then Flux (free tier), then Pexels, then
  placeholder, gpt-image-1 LAST.** gpt-image-1 is only reachable via explicit
  `--backend gpt-image-1`.
- Wan model/resolution/duration are **hardcoded constants** in `pipeline/video/wan.py`
  (wan2.2-i2v-flash, 720P, 5s) by user decision — don't make them env vars.
- macOS needs `ffmpeg-full` (plain Homebrew ffmpeg lacks libass → no `subtitles`
  filter). ffmpeg path args must be absolute (`.resolve()`) when `cwd=work_dir`.
- edge-tts needs `boundary="WordBoundary"` to emit word timestamps (captions
  depend on them).
- Subscribe/CTA scenes are only for listicle-style videos — story/dialogue videos
  end on the story's final beat (enforced in the system prompt).
- Browser automation of AI web UIs (AI Studio, Flow, etc.) was proposed and
  rejected — API-only integrations.

## Secrets — never commit keys (enforced)

- **Real keys live only in `.env`** (gitignored): `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`,
  `DASHSCOPE_API_URL`, `LITELLM_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, and the web app's `COGNITO_*`.
  Never paste a real key into chat, code, docs, or a commit — only `.env`.
- **`.env.example` is the only committed env file** — keys present, values empty.
- A **pre-commit hook** (`scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit`, zero-deps) blocks commits that
  add secret-looking files (`.env`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `id_rsa`, …) or content (PEM
  blocks, `sk-…`, `AKIA…`, `AIza…`, known `*_API_KEY=<real value>`). It scans only
  **staged additions**. Activate it once per clone:
  ```bash
  git config core.hooksPath scripts/git-hooks
  ```
- If it false-positives, fix the value/filename; `--no-verify` is a last resort, not a habit.

## Conventions

- Python 3.13+ (use `X | None` union syntax, `match` statements, etc. freely).
- Stage CLIs live in each module (`main()` + `__main__.py` for packages); keep new
  stages consistent with that pattern.
- `output/`, `music/`, `.env`, `.venv` are gitignored — never force-add them.
- CC-BY music in `music/` requires attribution (see `music/ATTRIBUTION.txt`).
